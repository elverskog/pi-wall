*π-Wall*

Just a small project to celebrate π-Day.

It creates a wall of curved bricks around a sphere. 

The interesting part being creating the correct curve and position for each brick's extrusion line.

For now the options (number of rows and bricks in each) are hardcoded.

You can just open index.html and hit the "b" key to trigger the build.
